// OOPs LAB Assignment 9
// Q2)  Create a class which stores account number, customer name and balance.
// Derive two classes from ‘Account’ class: ‘Savings’ and ‘Current’. The ‘Savings’
//class stores minimum balance. The ‘Current’ class stores the over-due amount.
// Include member functions in the appropriate class for
//      -deposit money 
//      -withdraw
//          [For saving account minimum balance should be checked.] 
//          [For current account overdue amount should be calculated.] 
//      -display balance Display data from each class using virtual function.
