// Q6) Create a class which stores employee name, id and salary. Derive two
// classes from 'Employee' class: 'Regular' and 'Part-Time'. The regular stores
// DA, HRA, Basic Salary. The part time class stores the number of hours and
// pay per hour. Calculate the salary of a reglar and a part-time employee.
